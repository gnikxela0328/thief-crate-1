<br />

A headless CDJ rig that comes complete with ssh/scp access and a c++ compiler (name another dj that...)
<br /><br />

# Why Thief Crate?
<br />
This will allow the user to have the full functionality of a pro CDJ setup at half the cost. The setup utilizes Mixxx, a free and open source dj software that is availble for Linux distributions (as well as other platforms). The controller is swappable, allowing the user to implement any MIDI device of their choice.

Granted, some of these parts are not necessary. The interface provides addtional input/output but can be easily replaced with a controller that has a soundcard compatible with Mixxx.
